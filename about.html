			<p class ="textBody p1"> The web had me at "hello world". There is something magical about typing a block of code to create a visual object on a screen. Web development hits all circuits of my creative brain. I am drawn to the visual, logical and problem solving nature that comes with web development. From creating web content to debugging a block of code, I find all aspects of the development process incredibly satisfying. </p>
			<p class ="textBody">Life is made up of stories. My skill is to communicate peoples stories through various mediums. I graduated from the University of Kansas in 2013 with a  Bachelor of Science degree in Journalism with an emphasis in Strategic Communication. As a student in the J-School, I gained real client experience, creating strategic planning and advertising executions for various local businesses. I am practiced at writing news releases, social media releases as well as research and strategy based planning documents and executions.</p> 
			
			<p class ="textBody">I am especially interested in the visual and design aspects of communication, that led me to pursue web development. I completed an associates of applied science in Web Development and Digital Media. The program covered the most current web techniques and taught me the languages HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript, Ajax and PHP. I gained a healthy knowledge of SEO and analytics as well as exposure to the most widely used content management systems. I have experience with  Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Dreamweaver. I am ready to take what I have learned and make my mark on the world.</p>
