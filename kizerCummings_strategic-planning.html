			<h1>Kizer Cummings Jewelers</h1>
			
			<p>In my message development journalism course, I created a strategic marketing plan for Kizer Cummings Jewelers. The goal of the campaign was to establish a brand identity of Kizer Cummings as being a next-generation store that engages in both traditional, in&ndash;store engagement ring selling as well as online selling. The campaign included a print advertisement, and a detailed strategic marketing plan that proposed ways to improve the company&#39;s online presence and establish a unique brand identity. This project helped me develop key research and writing skills, message development skills and design skills. The project also gave me experience working with a real client.</p>

						<h1>Research</h1>
						<p><strong>Target audience: </strong>The primary audience for this campaign is newly engaged males and females age 21 to 30.    According to weddingindustystatistics.com, 63 percent of brides-to-be aid in selecting their engagement ring, and 21 percent pick the ring themselves. Women tend to make the selection and the men make the decision (Meeting with Ernie Cummings). The campaign will target couples because most of the time the selection process is done together.</p>  
 
					
						<p>In 1974, Kizer Cummings Jewelers opened its door to the Lawrence community.  Located in downtown Lawrence on the historic Massachusetts Street, the specialty store sells unique fine jewelry.

						<p>Marks Jewelers, Inc. has been around since 1880.  It&#39;s the 14th oldest jewelry store in the nation. Marks promotes the good value of its jewelry and their employee&#39;s extensive knowledge of jewelry. </p>
						<p>Other direct competitors are Kansas City jewelers such as Shane Co., located in Overland Park, Kan., Jared with locations in Lenexa, Kan. and Overland Park, Kan.</p>

						
						<p><strong>Indirect Competitors:</strong> High end, luxury jewelry companies such as Tiffany&#39;s, Tivol and Helzberg all have locations in Kansas City, Mo.  These businesses are in the top tier of the market; what every jeweler recognizes as the luxury jewelry companies.</p>

The brand image should show that Kizer Cummings stands out from other jewelers because of its customization options that allow couples to create unique ring designs that fulfill their every desire and are particular to their relationship.

						<h1>Strategic Message</h1>
						<p> You, young, to&ndash;be engaged couples, should buy your engagement ring at Kizer Cummings Jewelers because Kizer Cummings offers trustworthy and sincere dedication to each customer, and offers computer customization that gives the customer the power to create a distinct symbol of their unique relationship.</p>  
						<p><strong>Rationale &ndash; </strong> The message that Kizer Cummings offers trustworthy and sincere dedication to each customer is going off the idea that people want to feel that they matter. According to Brian Martin&#39;s article, <a href="http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/marketing-successful-brands-satisfy-consumer-s-10-desires/141897/">&ldquo;Successful Brands Do a Good Job of Satisfying People&#39;s 10 Basic Desires&rdquo;</a>, one of the 10 basic desires is for people to feel that they matter. Kizer Cummings makes the customer feel that he or she matters, and that the customer is worthy of special attention.   </p> 

						<p>Kizer Cummings offers computer customization that gives the customer the power to create a distinct symbol of their unique relationship. Using <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/rapaille.html">Clotaire Rapaille&#39;s</a> advice, the code for engagement rings is a symbol of a unique relationship; a promise that you are choosing to be with that one person. It has been imprinted on a person since childhood that an engagement ring is a symbol of commitment with another person; a symbol of the institution of marriage.  The computer customization Kizer Cummings offers allows couples to be even more expressive in constructing this important symbol of their commitment to each other.   By giving couples the ability to design their own ring makes this symbol even more powerful.  </p>	

						<p>The second part of the message also fits into the top tier of Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of needs, self actualization; the desire for self&ndash;fulfillment, or the desire to be independent and self&ndash;serving; to become everything that one is capable of becoming. The customer feels that they went beyond what was offered and created something that is better than the classic rings. The fourth level of Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs, esteem needs, are the need for feelings of accomplishment, prestige and self worth.  This provides rationale for the idea that customers gain a feeling of pride and power knowing that they designed a custom engagement ring, distinct from the other traditional models.</p>
