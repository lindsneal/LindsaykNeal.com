			<h1>Duct Brand Duct Tape</h1>
			
			<p>In one of my journalism courses, I developed an advertising campaign for Duck Brand duct tape.  The campaign included a print advertisement, commercial and radio spot. This project helped me develop layout design, video editing and audio editing skills. The target audience for the campaign was do&ndash;it yourself&ndash;ers.</p>

						<h1>Research</h1>
						<p><strong>Target audience:</strong> Do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers.</p>
						<p>The primary audience for this campaign will be Do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers. Duck brand duct tape&#39;s unique qualities appeal to this type of person.  A do&dash;it&dash;yourselfer is a free&dash;thinker.  The Merriam Webster dictionary defines &#34;Do&dash;it&dash;yourself&#34; as: the activity of doing or making something without professional training or assistance, on one&#39;s own initiative.  This means that a do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;er tackles a project on their own and is comfortable in problem solving situations.  Do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers tend to be money conscious and willing to put their own time and effort into something in order to save money, instead of hiring a professional.  The focus is on homeowners, because they don&#39;t have a maintenance worker to fix things around the property.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of the year 2010, more than half of the homeowners in the U.S. were of the age 30 or older (www.census.gov).  The target is males and females, age 30 or older.</p> 
						<p>A do&dash;it&dash;yourselfer wants to be self&dash;reliant.  Motivated, hardworking and driven describe the personality of a do&dash;it&dash;yourselfer. They constantly encounter unique situations and need versatile products and tools in their endeavors.  This target can connect to the brand because it promotes multipurpose, inventive products that can guide them in their do&dash;it&dash;yourself efforts.</p> 

						<p><strong>Campaign Goal: </strong> Duck Brand has been focusing on the creative aspects and uses for duct tape but this campaign&#39;s goal is to target do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers needs by promoting the products versatility and convenience as well as the Brand uniqueness of the product.   The campaign should advertise the wide selection of colors and patterns Duck Brand offers to showcase the products ability to personalize a project. The goal of this campaign is to create an image that establishes Duck Brand duck tape as a unique material that can be used in a variety of situations.   A do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;er can use Duck Brand duct tape to solve a problem, refurbish an old item, or to create something new.  The campaign should demonstrate the practical benefits that are important to do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers, as well as stress the individuality Duck Brand Duct tape can create.  </p>
						<p><strong>Motivation: </strong> Duck Brand offers assurance of quality and consistency in their products that appeals to do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers. Duck Brand duct tape&#39;s versatile functions make the product a good choice for do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers.</p>
						<p>The appeal that will connect do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers to the Duck Brand is not only its quality, consistency and versatility, but also the sense of independence, accomplishment and pride that the customer feels when he or she uses the product.  Duck Brand duct tape gives do&dash;it&dash;your&dash;self&dash;ers the ability to accomplish any project on their own, without the help of others.   The brand&#39;s unique pattern options of duct tape allow a do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;er to personalize their project and put their own original stamp on whatever they are doing.  Duck brand duct tape appeals to the top two levels of the pyramid of Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs.   The fourth level, esteem needs, includes the need for feelings of accomplishment and prestige, or having a sense of making a contribution to the world.  Duck Brand duct tape helps the customer achieve this feeling.  The top tier of the hierarchy is self&dash;actualization needs.  Self&dash;Actualization is the desire for self&dash;fulfillment, the full use of talents, capabilities, and potential (about.com).  Duck Brand duct tape gives the target the tools to be self&dash;serving and independent. The products wide color and pattern options allow for the individuality that a do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;er seeks. </p>
						<p>Duck Brand Duck tape&#39;s benefits such as flexible and bendable ability, and its affordable price compared to other brands makes the product a necessary item for do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers.  Do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers are typically money conscious because they chose to fix a problem by themselves, instead of calling a pricey professional to do it for them. The brand slogan &#34;Got a project? Get the Duck to do it,&#34; allows the customer to feel that they can rely on the product to help them succeed, even when circumstances are tight (ShurTech Brands LLC, 2011).  </p>

						<p><strong>Desired Brand Image: </strong> In order to target do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers Duck Brand has to appeal to their original and inquisitive personality. Duck&#39;s desired brand image is to be a brand that offers a unique product that will makes the target stand out from the crowd.</p>
						<p>Duct tape is on a number of &#34;top 10&#34; lists of &#34;must have&#34; tools. The Duck Brand Duct tape is still the top brand among its competitors; blogs and websites have noted the Duck Brand&#39;s quality and innovation. One website claimed &#34;Duck Brand Duct tape is our favorite for consistently good quality tape.&#34; (DuctTapeGuys.com).  The product consistently receives good ratings and reviews from store websites; comments such as &#34;great price, colors, value, workmanship,&#34; and &#34;Out of all of the Duct Tape I Have used, this is the most durable duct tape, and comes in many colors.&#34;  (Michaels, 2010).   Duck Brand wants to keep this current image of quality, affordability and innovation.</p>

						<h1>Strategic Message</h1>
						<p>You, do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;ers, should buy Duck Brand because the brand provides a creative and colorful twist to the classic all-purpose tool that is versatile and affordable, and allows you to proudly create and accomplish original, unique projects all on your own.</p>
						<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The strategic message focuses on the major needs of a do&dash;it&dash;yourself&dash;er.  The message highlights the esteem needs on Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs, which includes the need for feelings of accomplishment and prestige, or having a sense of making a contribution to the world.  The message also reaches the top tier, or self&dash;actualization needs.  Self&dash;actualization is the longing to become everything that one is capable of becoming; independent and self&dash;serving.</p>
						<p><strong>Campaign Explanation:</strong> The goal of this advertising is to grab the attention of do&dash;it yourself&dash;ers and appeal to their emotions to get them to buy Duck brand duck tape.  I chose to use a clever, humorous headline that can be explained easily by the image.  The headline draws the reader&#39;s attention into the message.  The headline and the image go together they explain each other; the image show the dog and the duct tape and the headline explains the image.  I hope to relay the message that Duck brand duct tape stands out from other duct tape brands because of the brand&#39;s wide selection of color and pattern options, which gives the customer more options and allows for more creativity in their DIY projects.</p> 
						
						<p>The character of the dog can be used again in the radio and TV spot.  The theme of Duck brand duct tape being &ldquo;Man&#39;s Best Friend&rdquo; can be used in many forms of media.  The dog can become a familiar character tied with the Duck Brand.  Humor is the appeal for this ad and message and could be made into other forms of advertising.  I think the message of this ad can be used consistently across communications with the slogan &ldquo;most trusted companion&rdquo;, because it is a message that can be paired with different images and ideas.</p>
