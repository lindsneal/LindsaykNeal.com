			<h1>2013 Maker Faire KC</h1>
			
			<p>In 2012, for my capstone journalism course, I worked on a team with four other students to develop a marketing campaign for the Kansas City Maker Faire event.  
			This project helped me further develop and utilize my strategic communication skills with a real client for a real world event.  Throughout the process I learned essential leadership, time management and team work skills. In today&#39;s world, organizations look to gain attention, awareness and ultimately, engagement and attendance with their brand, by communicating effectively to their target audience.  To communicate effectively, thorough research, analysis and unique and targeted marketing tactics are needed to reach an audience and make a difference.</p>

						<h1>Secondary Research</h1>
						<p>The Maker Faire Kansas City is a two-day, family-friendly festival of invention, creativity and innovation. Maker faire started in Kansas City in 2012, sparked by the maker movement that has come about in recent years all across the world. Union Station hosts the annual event, showcasing hundreds of Makers and bringing in over 16,000 attendees just last year.</p> 
						<p>Maker Faire KC is currently active on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google+
						and its blog. Maker Faire KC currently has just over 1,000 Facebook likes and 400 Twitter
						followers.</p>
						<p><strong>Event Analysis:</strong>  The Maker movement is a tech&dash;influenced DIY community.  MAKE magazine started in 2005 and has helped foster the maker movement in recent years. (Makerfaire.com) Makers pride themselves on being able to create innovative new products and services using their own skill, expertise and creativity.  Makers are thinkers who love to create, build, design and learn.</p>
						<p class="sources">&#34;Making and creating is kind of an everyday thing that lots of people do.  It doesn&#39;t have to be elevated; it&#39;s not something that just geniuses do. We are all inventors, we are all makers&#34;</p>
						<p class="sources">--Dale Dougherty, the founder of make magazine.</p>
						
						<p>The maker movement has added to society with the discovery of new inventions and techniques such as the 3D printer.  In this age of computers and technology people have become reliant on technology and electronics, and many people have forgotten to analysis how things are made and how things work.  Our society has strayed from the old fashioned, do&dash;it&dash;yourself mentality.  The Maker movement is about bringing grassroots innovation to all communities and inspiring people to start making again.</p>
						<p>The Maker Faire is an event established by the Maker movement.  The family friendly event is known as the &#34;Greatest show and tell on earth&#34;. (Makerfair.com)  It began as a place where creative Makers such as engineers, scientists, crafters, educators, artists, students and tech enthusiasts come together and showcase their innovations and inspire the community to become Makers.</p>
						<p>The Maker Faire exhibits forward thinking, innovative and experimental designs that encompass technology, art, engineering and science.  The mission of the Maker Faire is to inspire people to become passionate about making and to bring Makers together to connect and share ideas with each other.  The fair is designed to show people how to tinker, hack, create and make things that can improve our world. </p>
						<p>The first Maker Faire started in 2006 in San Mateo, California and has expanded over the years to Detroit and New York. The flagship Maker Faires are held annually and are sponsored by MAKE Magazine and O&#39;Reilly Media.  The New York fair is known as the &#34;World Maker Fair&#34;.  In 2012, 165,000 people attended the Bay Area and New York fairs.  Community sponsored Mini Maker Faires are starting up around the world, with over 60 expected this year. (Makerfair.com) </p>

						<h1>Primary Research</h1>
						<p>Our primary research consisted of multiple focus groups and an online survey. Seven focus groups were conducted with a total of 38 participants. 464 people participated in the online survey. Of the participants 89 were male and 222 were female, ranging from age 18 to 58 or older.</p>
						<p>Only 46 participants of the online survey had heard of Maker Faire KC. The research showed Facebook, Twitter, radio and TV were the most common media outlets for our target audience to receive information. Participants of the focus group also noted Email as a preferred method of communication. Almost three-fourths of KU students responded that their preferred media outlet is social media.</p>

							<h1>Campaign Goals</h1>
							
							<p><strong>Goal 1: </strong>To increase general awareness of Maker Faire KC among KU students, Makers and residents within the Lawrence community.</p>
							
							<p><strong>Goal 2: </strong>To increase number of makers by at least 10 percent.</p>
							
							<p><strong>Goal 3: </strong>To increase attendance at Maker Faire KC 2013 by 25 percent.</p>
							
							<p><strong>Statement of purpose: </strong>To increase attendance and awareness of Maker
								Faire KC among KU students and Lawrence residents. Specifically, this
								campaign aims to increase attendance of Makers from Lawrence, especially
								KU students. Research shows that there is an extremely high interest
								in the topics of the event, but an extremely low amount of people are aware
								of what it is. In the report we highlight ways to obtain top-of-mind awareness
								for Maker Faire KC.</p>
							
							<h1>&ldquo;MAKE something today. CHANGE tomorrow.&rdquo;  </h1>
							
							<p>The campaign was designed to convey the message that every person has the ability to make an impact in this world. The maker movement is designed to let children and adults tinker, hack, learn, build and create in areas such as technology, science, electronics, arts, architecture, engineering, culinary and more.  The goal of Maker Faire KC is to inspire kids join the Maker movement and get involved with STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) education.  The fair fosters innovation and change in our world.</p>
							
							<h1>&ldquo;I&#39;m a maker, and you are too.&rdquo;</h1>
							
							<p>We used this message throughout the campaign to help people understand that everyone is a Maker and everyone has a passion for something. We are all makers.</p>

							</div>
							<h1>Key Objectives &amp; Tactics</h1>
							<p>The campaign involved both traditional and non&ndash;traditional marketing strategies. Print ads, billboards and direct mail pieces were some of the traditional methods used in the campaign. Maker Faire is a hands-on event, with the main purpose of getting attendees to engage, play and learn. We wanted to convey this same idea in our marketing tactics. We created print ads that were interactive and involved a &ldquo;How To&rdquo; lesson for the recipient to learn. The direct mail piece was also interactive; incorporating a kit to construct an origami Maker Faire robot.  The direct mail piece is a fun activity that sparks interest and promotes engagement with the brand with the hope of drawing more people to attend the event. </p>
							
							<p class="objective"><strong>Objective: </strong>Print Advertisements (posters, flyers and newspaper ads)</p>
								<p class="tactic"><em>Tactic: </em>Posters will be hung around campus and in Lawrence retail stores
								and libraries. Flyers will be given out at all events and around KU campus. They
								will be printed on 100 lb. Paper Gloss at 8.5&rdquo;x11&rdquo;.</p>

								an incentive for people to actually attend the event. It will help push our
